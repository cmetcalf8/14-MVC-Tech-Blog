In the command line you need to run "npm i" to download the dependencies. Then initate the database with "mysql -u root -p". Afterwards "source db/schema.sql" to create the tables. Exit your sql and enter "npm run seed" to seed the data into your tables.  Finally you can run "npm start" to start your server. This project was deployed to Heroku.
